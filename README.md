# Indian-Stock-Market-Prediction-System
The Indian Stock Market Prediction System aims to develop a sophisticated forecasting tool specifically calibrated for the unique characteristics of Indian financial markets. The project addresses multiple challenges inherent to emerging markets by integrating advanced machine learning algorithms, technical analysis methodologies, and natural language processing techniques.
Key objectives include:

1.Creating accurate 5-day price forecasts for both individual Indian stocks (NSE/BSE listed) and major indices
2.Integrating news sentiment analysis from Indian financial publications to capture market sentiment
3.Providing contextual explanations alongside predictions to aid investment decision-making
4.Handling the unique challenges of Indian market data including irregular trading patterns and liquidity concerns
5.Visualizing historical data alongside predictions to identify trend patterns and potential reversal points
6.Developing an end-to-end prediction pipeline from data collection to detailed forecast explanation

The system aims to serve various stakeholders including retail investors, financial analysts, and algorithmic traders by providing data-driven insights tailored to the Indian market ecosystem.
